PyDF_Chain
==========

The great software PDF Chain stopped working on my Ubuntu 12.04 distribution, so I need an alternative. This is it. This rather simple software merges several pdfs into one.

It is far from perfect, but it solves problem I had and as thus will not be subject to further development.
